A collection of Java implementations for various design patterns, committed as part of learning and practicing design patterns.
# DesignPattern-JAVA

This repository contains my learning journey with various **Design Patterns** in Java. Each pattern is implemented with clear examples and explanations to understand its use cases and applications in software development.

## Design Patterns Covered:

- **Creational Patterns**
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Prototype

- **Structural Patterns**
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy

- **Behavioral Patterns**
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor

## Structure:
- Each design pattern has its own directory with:
  - **Java code implementations**
  - **Comments** explaining key concepts
  - **Example scenarios** where the pattern is useful

## Why Design Patterns?
Design patterns provide tried-and-tested solutions to common software design problems. They help:
- Improve code readability
- Ensure scalability
- Make future enhancements easier

## How to Use:
Clone the repository and explore the pattern implementations. Each pattern is in its respective directory with example code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dani7867/DesignPattern-JAVA.git
